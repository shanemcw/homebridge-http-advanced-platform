# Historical service inventory

Generated against installed Homebridge 1.11.4 and 2.4.0. Unavailable historical services are not silently substituted. They also cannot be constructed by the old plugin on the same runtime. Service availability alone does not prove full support for complex services such as camera streaming.

BatteryService is explicitly mapped to Battery with the same HAP UUID. The dormant legacy extension file was not imported by the original entry point; FanIR/TVIR were not an exposed working plugin feature.

`BatteryService` can also be an entry in a device's `additionalServices` array. It then shares that device's HomeKit accessory identity and uses the entry's stable `id` as its service subtype. The same arrangement works for other available HAP service types. See the [Front Door example](../README.md#add-battery-information-to-a-device). This inventory records service constructor availability; it does not guarantee that Apple Home will display every service type or that a particular characteristic mapping is suitable for a device.
